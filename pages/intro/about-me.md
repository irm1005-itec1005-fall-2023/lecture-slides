# Hi I'm Neil!
Yes, that's me in my super cool C4C jacket

* I'm a senior developer at Statistics Canada
* I have a passion for biking everywhere and am trying to learn more about municipal housing policy
* I love building web apps, my favourite framework is VueJS and that is the hill I will die on
* You can call me "Neil"
* "Professor" works as well

<!--

Slide notes: 

* I'm Neil Mispelaar
* Pronouns he / him
* I'm a seniors dev at Stats Can. I've been with the public service for too many years 
* I've also done some private sector work and consulting, but my main calling is the GoC 
* My last name is a bit of pain for people to say so you can just call me Neil 
* That's a picture of me in my Code for Canada jacket - we'll talk more about that later
* If you ever want to start a fight with developers online, just say what framework you use - people get very defensive - I don't get it - and I'm not trying to pick a fight with anyone - just being open and transparent

# Backgrounder 
Where are you from

* Born in India
* Moved to Canada
* Then moved to Zimbabwe
* Then came back to Canada
* Lived in suburban Ottawa
* Then moved downtown

<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* So, I live in downtown Ottawa, just near Tunney's Pasture
* I love Ottawa, it's a great city, but boy does it have it's challenges (and we can talk about those in a future lesson)
* I was actually born in India (not saying when exactly to avoid aging myself)
* But I spent a lof of formative years in Africa 
* Zimbabwe to be specific 
* Actually, When we came back to Canada I did my post secondary at Algonquin College
* After school I moved to the suburbs, which I really didn't love, and after some big life changes, I ended up moving downtown 
* Which turned out to be the best thing ever because I met my partner Kate
* And that's a picture of our house that we built 
* (Please don't come to my house :-) )

# Some really important people in my life
The other things that I love talking about

* Kate
* Buster
* Brother
* Mom and Dad

<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* So the most important person in the world for me (apart from all of you ofcourse) is Kate
* Kate and I met seven years ago, dated for two and then married for five 
* This isn't an advertisement or endorsement, but we met on e-harmony, went on one date, and that was it
* Kate's a consultant. She has her own consultancy - and she does feminist research for Governments, Agencies, and companies all over the world
* Kate brought with her, her dog Buster into the relationship
* I was never really a dog person, but dammit Buster melted my heart 
* At first he was a bit like "who is this dude", but now we're best of friends 
* I have one sibling, a younger brother 
* He's an entrepreneur, he actually owns a cannabis store in Kanata South, so that's fun
* And, lastly, my Mom's a teacher in Barrhaven, and my Dad is still in Africa, working as a consultant in Mozambique

# Interests
Because there is more to life than just code

* Coffee
* Politics
* Housing policy
* Municipal zoning
* Biking everywhere
* The fake war on cars
* Travel
* Old fashions
* Naps 


<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* It's important that you focus on work, on school, on coding, on learning, on keeping up with the pace of the industry
* But, it's also really important that you take care of your mental health
* Burn out in this industry is high

Stress leave story: 
* One story I have, when I was at ESDC, a colleague of mine was on the Multimedia Production team, doing videos and presentations for the Minister
* The job involved filming events, cutting videos, and preparing Keynote presentations, it was tough keeping up with the Minister's schedule of events 
* He was able to this for six months, but then he burnt out, and had to go on stress leave for three months 

In conclusion: 
* I'm not saying, that had he just drank more coffee, or talked about politics, he wouldn't have burned out, that's not the lesson here
* The lesson is to try to take care of your mental health
* Work really hard, but also do things that bring joy to your life 
* And part of that, is being passionate about the things that you are really interested in, or love doing 
* And also, if you like these things too, let's chat

## Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)

Team Lead

<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

Why the change:
* When a new political party comes to power, one thing they often do is make a bunch of changes to the way departments are setup
* Agencies and departments like CRA, Statistics Canada, National Parks, Defence, are always safe, but the other smaller departments are usually moved around, or restructured or just changed in someway 
* And so, in the early 2010's, there was a lot of changes happening, and Employment and Social Development Canada was "born" as a "new" department 

Change brought opportunity: 
* And so, I had really hustled hard at HRDC, and so when we were going through this transition period, my Manager at the time offered me a team lead spot, to manage a team of five developers, which I was happy to take on 

Here's the thing about Team Lead spots: 
* So, for me, as team lead, I didn't love
  * the sheer amount of meetings that you had to attend
  * the fact that you can't code all the time 
  * the politicking 
* Loved the extra pay, but didn't enjoy the team lead spot as much as I thought I would

## Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)

Web Specialist


<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* Move ahead a couple of years...

TBS directive on a11y and Canada.ca conversion: 

* The Government of Canada was really busy trying to improve their online experience for Canadiands
* And so we started building tools like WET (Web Experience Toolkit), and really began iterating quickly on enhanced templates for Canada.ca
* Remember the Government of Canada has hundreds of different websites, and tens of thousands of different pages to manage, it was a mess
* And so every department was mandated that they had to move to this new Canada.ca template, and make their sites compliant for accessibility, for all of their pages 
* ESDC alone was sitting on thousands and thousands of pages that needed to be upgraded 

Canadians were demanding more out of departmental websites: 

* The other thing that was happening wsa huge advances in web development
* Experiences were getting more interactive, consumers were more demanding 
* Web Developers needed to up their game 

ESDC solution: 

* And so, the department setup a number of special projects, and created a "Web Specialist" position to help get all this more advanced work done

## Statistics Canada

Front end Developer


<!-- 

Slide Notes: 

* After the successful launch of ESDC's content on Canada.ca, I was bit by the JavaScript bug. 
* I wanted to learn more about advanced front end web development
* Sadly, the team that I was on, wasn't in the business of making web apps or doing heavy development tasks
* And so, I started to take training on front end dev, and tried to get on small front end dev projects, to build up my resume 
* And finally, after a year or so of beefing up my resume, I got a job offer to join Statistics Canada as a Front end dev working on the UX team
