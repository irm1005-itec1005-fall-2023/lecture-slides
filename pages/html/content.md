# Headings
Marking up content

Heading elements allow you to specify what content on your page is a heading or sub heading.

* There should only be one `<h1>` on the page
* Do not skip heading levels

```html
<!-- 6 heading levels: -->
<h1>Earth</h1>
  <h2>North America</h2>
    <h3>Canada</h3>
      <h4>Ontario</h4>
        <h5>Ottawa</h5>
          <h6>Kanata</h6>
    <h3>United States</h3>
      <h4>California</h4>
  <h2>Africa</h2>
    <h3>Egypt</h3>
      <h4>Cairo</h4>
```

# Links
Marking up content

Links are the key to the whole web! Here's how to make a link. 

First identify the text that you want to make a link.

```html
<p>Buster likes to go the groomer name <a>Martin</a></p>
```

Then add an `href` attribute to the `<a>` tag. 

```html
<p>Buster likes to go the groomer name <a href="">Martin</a></p>
```

Finally, add the web address to the `href` attribute 

```html
<p>Buster likes to go the groomer name <a href="https://martin.cutshair.com">Martin</a></p>
```

<div class="text-sm">

# Images
Marking up content

The `<img>` tag is used to display images on a web page.

* Images need two attributes to specify extra details about the image: 
  * `src` - the location of the image and;
  * `alt` - the description of the meaningful information in the image (or empty if the image is decorative)

```html
<img src="buster.jpg" alt="Photo of Buster" />
```

<div class="text-sm">

# Line break
Marking up content

If you ever need to force a line break (enter / new line) in your content you can use the `<br />` tag to acheive this.

  * `br />` - Self closing tag and must have the trailing slash `/` 
  * `<br/>` - Can also be written without the space 

```html
<p>This is a paragraph<br />
   And this is on a new line<br />
   Also this is on a new line<br />
   And one more new line for good luck</p>
```

<div class="text-sm">

The strong importance element

The `<strong>` element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. 

* Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
* **Note:** Do not use the `<b>` tag to add emphasis or importance to content

```html
<p>... the most important rule, the rule you can never forget, 
    no matter how much he cries, no matter 
    how much he begs: <strong>never feed him 
    after midnight</strong>.</p>

title: Blockquote

# Blockquote
Marking up content

The `<blockquote>` element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. 

* Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). 

```html
<blockquote>
    <p>The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with.
  It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held
  prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to
  be true. But our preferences do not determine what's true.</p>
</blockquote>
```
